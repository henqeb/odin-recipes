    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients (6 servings)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li> 
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons margarine</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt and sugar. 
            Pour in milk, eggs and cream, and stir into a smooth batter. Meanwhile, 
            melt margarine in a cast iron skillet. Pour the batter over the melted margarine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the skillet in the oven, and bake for 35 minutes. The pancake 
            will rise to form a bubble in the middle. Remove from the oven, and 
            let cool until the pancake sets, or goes down. Cut into pieces, serve 
            with maple syrup and enjoy!
